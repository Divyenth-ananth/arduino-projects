# Arduino projects

## 1. Color Sorting Robot Arm
This project implements an automated color-sorting robot arm using Arduino. The robot arm is capable of identifying and sorting objects based on their color. It uses a color sensor to detect the color of an object and then places it into the designated bin or location using servo motors.

### Features:
* Detects colors using a TCS3200/TCS34725 color sensor.
* Operates a robotic arm with servo motors for sorting.
* Customizable sorting logic to assign colors to specific bins.
* Ideal for learning about robotics, color detection, and Arduino-based automation.

## 2. 7-Segment Display Digital Basketball Net Counter
This project is a digital scoreboard system for a basketball net using Arduino. It uses 7-segment displays to count and display scores in real time. Players can increment the score using push buttons, making it ideal for small-scale basketball games or score tracking.

### Features:
* Displays the score on common cathode/anode 7-segment displays.
* Implements increment counters with push buttons for scorekeeping.
* Resets scores easily using a reset button.
* Smooth real-time updates for an engaging user experience.
